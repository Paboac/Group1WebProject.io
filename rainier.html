                        Mount Rainier resides in southeast Pierce County and northeast Lewis County in Washington State. The park was established on March 2, 1899, as the fifth national park in the United States, preserving over 369 miles of land.

                    <p>
                        The mountain rises abruptly from the surrounding land with elevations in the park ranging from 1,600 feet to over 14,000 feet. The highest point in the Cascade Range, Mount Rainier is surrounded by valleys, waterfalls, subalpine meadows, and 91,000 acres
                        of old-growth forest.

                        Mount Rainier is an episodically active composite volcano, also called a stratovolcano. Volcanic activity began between one-half and one million years ago, with the most recent eruption cycle ending close to 1,000 years ago. Over the past half-million
                        years, Mount Rainier has erupted multiple times, alternating between periods of high volume and low volume eruptions. The eruptions built up layer after layer of lava and rubble, eventually forming the tall cone that you see today-
                        and is common among composite volcanos.

                        At one time, lava flows on opposite sides of the mountain probably projected more than 1,000 feet above the present summit at Columbia Crest which rises 14,410 feet above sea level on the rim of the recent lava cone. The upper portion of the volcano’s
                        cone was likely removed by explosions and landslides. Mount Rainier’s extensive glacier system then carved the volcano’s cone into its current rough form.
