                        Is a potentially active stratovolcano in the Cascade Volcanic Arc. It was formed by a subduction zone on the Pacific Coast and rests in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is located about 50 miles southeast of Portland, on the border
                        between Clackamas and Hood River counties.

                        Standing at 11,239 feet (3,425 meters), Mount Hood is the highest point in Oregon and the fourth highest peak in the Cascade Range. Mount Hood is also well-known for its geology, history, natural environment, and culture, as these characteristics have
                        not only helped to shape northwest Oregon but the entire Pacific Northwest.

                        The glacially eroded summit area consists of several andesitic or dacitic lava domes; Pleistocene collapses produced avalanches and lahars (rapidly moving mudflows) that traveled across the Columbia River to the north. The eroded volcano has had at least
                        four major eruptive periods during the past 15,000 years. The last three eruptions at Mount Hood occurred within the past 1,800 years from vents high on the southwest flank and produced deposits that were distributed primarily
                        to the south and west along the Sandy and Zigzag rivers. The last eruptive period took place around 220 to 170 years ago, when dacitic lava domes, pyroclastic flows, and mudflows were produced without major explosive eruptions.
                        The prominent Crater Rock just below the summit is hypothesized to be the remains of one of these now-eroded domes. This period includes the last major eruption of 1781 to 1782 with a slightly more recent episode ending shortly
                        before the arrival of the explorer Lewis and Clark in 1805. The latest minor eruptive event occurred in August 1907.
